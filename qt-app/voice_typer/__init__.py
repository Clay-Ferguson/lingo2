"""Lingo Voice Typer: system-wide voice-to-text input for Linux.

Listens to the microphone, transcribes speech with whisper.cpp, and injects
the result as keystrokes via the XDG Remote Desktop Portal, so the text lands
in whatever application currently has keyboard focus.

Module layout deliberately keeps the Qt-free logic separate from the GUI:
`config` and `transcribe` import no Qt at all and can be exercised without a
display; `audio` and `keyboard` are QObjects only because they need signals
and D-Bus; `window` is the only module that knows about widgets.
